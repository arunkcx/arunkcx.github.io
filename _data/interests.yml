  In my free time I enjoy gaming on my Steam Deck, playing some great story driven titles, maybe some Helldivers 2, 
  or working on my blog on <a href="https://www.arunkc.com"> here. </a> I'm also a huge tinkerer working on 
  all sorts of electronic and geeky stuff, couple of raspis and sff optiplexes running a homelab, breaking
  my head with Linux commands (when in doubt, reinstall the OS right?! Haha!). I also like travelling 
  on the weekends and checking out new places, trying new experiences and having fun!
